## 📌 Project Overview
This is a Deep Learning project developed by *Aman Singh* (NIET, Greater Noida). It uses a *Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)* to automatically detect and classify diseases in plant leaves.

The model is trained to recognize *38 different classes* of plant diseases (including Apple, Tomato, Potato, Corn, etc.) with high accuracy.

## 📂 Dataset
The model was trained on a large dataset containing over *87,000 images* of healthy and diseased crop leaves.
